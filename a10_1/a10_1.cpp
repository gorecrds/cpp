 * Descrip.:Program that introduces a class that does arithmetic operations (adding,subtracting, multiplying and dividing) with 2 fractions.
 * It also compares if fractions are equal by calling a method that returns either true  of false. It also introduces a constructor class as well as a function that simplifies fractions.
